# 🔐 cryptography_project

A Python-based educational toolkit that demonstrates **secure communication** and **digital signature systems** using modern cryptographic methods.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project consists of two main parts:

### ✅ Part A: Secure Chat with ECC
A GUI-based secure chat demo between Alice and Bob using:
- **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)** for shared key exchange
- **AES-GCM** for authenticated encryption
- **ECDSA** for digital signatures

### ✅ Part B: Digital Signature Forgery Simulation (RSA)
A console-based demonstration of:
- **RSA key generation, signing, and verification**
- **Signature forgery attack simulation** (highlighting dangers of signing without hashing)
